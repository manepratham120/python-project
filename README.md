                                                       File Compression
This project is an implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for file compression in the Python programming language, utilizing the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI).
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequency of occurrence.
This allows more frequent characters to have shorter codes, resulting in efficient compression.

Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

huffman.py: This file contains the implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for file compression. It provides methods for compressing and decompressing files using Huffman coding.

gui.py: This file contains the implementation of the graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. It provides an interactive interface for selecting files to compress and decompress.

filecompression.py: this file contains the implementation of file compression program by merging Tkinter gui and huffman coding algorithm for compression
